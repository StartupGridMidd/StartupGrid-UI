      <h1>The Grid</h1>
      <p>We are a diverse team of Middlebury College students embarking on our first venture so others have the framework to start theirs.</p>
      <p>Instead of leaving it to time-starved entrepreneurs to filter through thousands of opinions, our team has gathered, curated, and organized the best startup material into one place. Weâ€™re adding a human element to this collection by incorporating exclusive interviews with top thought leaders because we believe everyone should be given the opportunity to follow their passion.</p>
      <p>After twenty-five days, hundreds of heady toppers, and thousands of curated posts we have set in motion a project to empower and engage the entrepreneurship community to organize its knowledge.</p>
