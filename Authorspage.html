          Starting a company is hard, finding the right advice shouldn’t be.
          As entrepreneurship becomes more fashionable, so does offering startup advice. But it’s everywhere, it’s messy, it’s disorganized and it’s of inconsistent quality. Instead of leaving it to a time-starved entrepreneur to navigate a whole Internet’s worth of content, we’re gathering, curating, and organizing the best startup material in one place. To this collection, we’re adding a much-needed human element by including video clips from New England’s startup authorities. It’s our way of helping entrepreneurs save valuable time and avoid reinventing the wheel.
